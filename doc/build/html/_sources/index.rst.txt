Disclaimer (by BN)
------------------
A fork of the excellent package `async_v20 <https://github.com/jamespeterschinner/async_v20>`_.
As OANDA is changing its API a bit and does not well document it, the original version of async-v20 is
not fully functional at the moment.
This fork is a bit updated, allowing some additional keyword arguments and JSON structures that OANDA sends
and/or requests.


Disclaimer
----------

- **Losses can exceed investment.**
- async_v20 and its creator has no affiliation with OANDA. And is not endorsed by OANDA in any manner.
- async_v20 is in Beta stage and has not been tested on a live OANDA account
- **Use at own risk**

Features
---------

- Exposes the entire `v20 API <http://developer.oanda.com/rest-live-v20/introduction/>`_
- immutable objects
- No `*args, **kwargs` In client methods. So no guessing what arguments a method takes
- Serialize objects directly into *pandas* **Series** or **DataFrame** objects
- Construct :term:`concurrent` trading algorithms

.. _installation:

installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install async_v20

:term:`async_v20` is built with `aiohttp <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp>`_.
It is therefore recommended to also install :term:`cchardet` and :term:`aiodns` as per :term:`aiohttp`
`documentation <http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ `

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install cchardet

   $ pip install aiodns

Why async_v20?
--------------

There are many OANDA clients for python already available so why create another?
The main driver for creating async_v20 was to facilitate better risk management,
by allowing user's to concurrently monitor account status and trade currency's.

An unintended consequence of async_v20 is the ability to create clear segregation
between implementation ideas.

A simple example might contain a coroutine for the following:

    - Monitoring overall account status
    - Watching price stream and triggering buy/sell signals
    - Monitoring individual trades and closing movements against held positions

A synchronous implementation would require considerable effort to determine which
task communicates with the server next. async_v20 removes this burden by using
`aiohttp <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp>`_

Further goals of async_v20 has been to lower the barrier of entry for algorithmic trading
by providing a complete and simple to use interface.
